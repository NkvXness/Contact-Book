# Utilities Layer

This directory contains utility functions and helper modules used throughout the application.

## Current Utilities

- **validators.js** - Form validation functions with error handling
- **constants.js** - Application constants, selectors, and configuration

## Architecture Pattern

Utilities are pure functions that:
- Have no side effects
- Return consistent results
- Can be easily tested
- Promote code reuse across components
