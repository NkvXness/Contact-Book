# Services Layer

This directory contains service classes that handle business logic and data management.

## Current Services

- **StorageService.js** - Browser localStorage operations with error handling
- **ContactService.js** - CRUD operations for contacts with validation
- **GroupService.js** - Group management and organization logic

## Architecture Pattern

Services follow a static class pattern with clear separation of concerns:
- Data persistence (StorageService)
- Business logic (Contact/GroupService)
- Validation and error handling
- Event emission for UI updates
