# Components Layer

This directory contains UI components following modern JavaScript component patterns.

## Current Components

- **BaseComponent.js** - Base class with common DOM manipulation utilities
- **GroupManager.js** - Group creation, editing, and selection interface
- **ContactForm.js** - Contact creation and editing form with validation

## Architecture Pattern

Components extend BaseComponent and follow these principles:
- Event-driven communication
- Automatic cleanup of event listeners
- Separation of UI logic from business logic
- Consistent DOM manipulation patterns
